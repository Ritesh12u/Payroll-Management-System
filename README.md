# Payroll Management System

The Payroll Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate the process of managing employee payroll with real-time salary calculations. This application allows users to input employee details such as name, hours worked, hourly rate, and tax rate to instantly compute gross salary, tax deductions, and net salary.

## Features

- **Real-time Payroll Calculations**: Calculates gross pay, tax deductions, and net salary on the fly.
- **Simple Data Entry**: User-friendly form for employee name, hours worked, hourly pay rate, and tax percentage.
- **Tax Compliance**: Supports accurate tax calculations based on rates input to ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Clear Payroll Summary**: Displays a concise breakdown of gross salary, tax amount, and net pay.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean UI optimized for all devices including desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Runs entirely on the client side using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no backend dependency.

## How It Works

Users enter employee payroll data into well-labeled fields. Upon submitting, the system calculates the total pay as hours multiplied by hourly rate. It then computes tax deductions from the gross salary according to the tax rate input, and finally provides the net salary after tax deduction. The results are displayed immediately on the page in a clear, readable format.

The application improves payroll management by reducing errors inherent in manual calculations, speeding up the payroll process, and providing easily understandable payroll summaries. It is ideal for small businesses, freelancers, or HR personnel looking for a simple, effective payroll calculator without complex software.
